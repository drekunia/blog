Last year I got laid off from my software engineering job.

Not gonna lie—it stung. I’d spent years building backend systems, writing clean code, and working on scalable architectures. Suddenly, all of that stability was gone.

But after the shock wore off, I had this thought: *if I’m going to start over anyway, why not start over doing something I actually love?*

That’s how I ended up on this new path—trying to break into the game industry.

## Facing the Competition

The first thing I realized is just how **crowded** game development is in 2025. With engines like Unity, Unreal, and Godot being so accessible, there are students, hobbyists, and indie devs everywhere.

At first, it was overwhelming. But then I reminded myself: everyone starts somewhere. I don’t need to compete with the world right away—I just need to **make things, finish them, and learn from the process.** Even tiny finished games matter.

## Learning Feels Like Being a Junior Again

Coming from software engineering, I thought, “I’ve got this, I already know how to code.” Yeah… game dev quickly humbled me.

Rendering pipelines, shaders, physics systems, AI, networking—suddenly I was back in beginner mode.

It’s frustrating sometimes, but also refreshing. Every new thing I learn feels like unlocking a new skill tree. And honestly, it’s exciting to feel like a student again.

## Making Peace With AI

Another big shift has been AI. It’s everywhere in game development now—helping with code, assets, even design ideas.

At first, I worried. *Would AI replace me before I even got my foot in the door?*

But I’ve realized that AI isn’t the end of creativity—it’s a tool that makes creativity faster. It doesn’t take away the fun parts of game dev; it helps me spend more time on them. It’s like having an extra teammate who never sleeps.

## Indie or Studio?

I still don’t know if I’ll end up at a studio or carving out an indie path.

- Studios offer teamwork and big projects, but breaking in requires a strong portfolio.
- Indie gives me freedom, but also means being my own coder, artist, marketer, and businessperson.

For now, I’m experimenting—making small indie-style projects to learn, while also building a portfolio that could get a studio’s attention. Both paths feel open.

## Finding Strength in Community

After the layoff, I felt a bit isolated. But joining game dev communities changed that. Game jams, Discord groups, and sharing progress online have been huge for keeping me motivated.

It’s not just networking—it’s encouragement. Seeing other people build amazing stuff reminds me why I started, and sharing my own messy prototypes makes the journey feel less lonely.

## The Spark That Keeps Me Going

There are still days I doubt myself. The layoff shook my confidence, and the game industry is tough to crack.

But every time I see something come alive on screen—an AI enemy moving, a particle effect working, or even just a basic menu—I feel this spark I never had in my old job.

That spark makes the challenges worth it.

## Where I Am Now

I’m not in the industry yet. I’m still learning, still building, still figuring things out. But I’ve turned a layoff into a chance to chase something I’ve always wanted.

If you’re in a similar spot—whether laid off or just thinking about switching paths—here’s what’s helped me so far:

- **Start small. Finish things.**
- **Learn the game-specific skills.**
- **Don’t fight AI—use it to your advantage.**
- **Find a community—you’ll learn and grow faster.**
- **Hold on to the joy—it’s your fuel.**

The layoff closed one door, but it opened another. I don’t know exactly where this journey leads, but for the first time in a while, I feel excited about what’s next.
