{: .prompt-info }

I'm a game developer and 3D artist with extensive experience in backend engineering. I do some music and 2D arts too, and other bunch of kinda technical random stuff, like playing with electronics. I write or make yapping videos when I have the inspiration and spare energy to spend ~~or I'll just take naps, or doze off, or do some random thing~~.

You can see some of my works here:

- [GitHub](https://www.github.com/drekunia)
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/drekunia)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@drekunia)

I'll just put some other links here:

Or just [send me an email](mailto:drekunia@gmail.com) if you need a more "official" way to talk.

Sorry, I don't want to spend too much time on this page and these personal website stuff.
